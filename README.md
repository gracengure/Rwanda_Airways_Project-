#### Project Overview

Rwanda Airways is a web application aimed at providing customers with a seamless booking experience for flights with Rwanda Airways. The platform allows users to browse available flight options, make bookings, and manage their travel preferences. By offering an easy-to-use interface for booking flights, Rwanda Airways seeks to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline the travel booking process.
#### Problem Statement

The lack of a modern, user-friendly platform for flight booking has resulted in a cumbersome and inefficient experience for potential passengers. Customers currently face difficulties in finding flight information, booking tickets, and managing their trips online. The Rwanda Airways web platform addresses these challenges by providing an efficient, accessible, and intuitive system for customers to plan and book their travels.
